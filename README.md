## Goal
The `stereoscopic` project combines low-cost high-quality commercially
available hardware and open source software enabling a point-and-shoot
digital stereoscopic camera experience.

This rig could also be used for scanning books with some mounting
modifications.

Think digital Nimslo 3D to animated gif!

## Status
The `stereoscopic` project is currently in the ideation and requirements
gathering stage.

## Discussion
#### Sensors
For `v1` I decided to go with the Canon Powershot A3300 IS plus CHDK
firmware due to low cost, feature set, availability, and prior art using
these cameras. For a higher budget version, I would opt for a DSLR camera
fully supported by `gphoto2` and a manual remote switch so no need to fuss
around with used equipment and potential firmware compatibility issues.

#### Full Spectrum
It may be possible to extend into UV and IR ranges by:
1. Remove camera Hot Filter and use neutral Full Spectrum glass
2. Purchase some filters

Or for such a cheap camera it may be possible to:
1. Use a dark room with long exposures
2. Expose to UV or IR light sources
